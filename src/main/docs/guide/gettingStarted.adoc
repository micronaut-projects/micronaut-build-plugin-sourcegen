The most likely structure for a project that wants to utilize this consists of 3 modules:

* Common module with task logic.
* Module with generated Gradle plugin sources and possible user extensions.
* Module with generated Maven plugin sources and possible user extensions.

The 3 modules might be in different repositories. It is possible to use a single module, but it is not recommended.
